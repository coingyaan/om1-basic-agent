# OM1 Learning Notes

This file documents my learning journey while building and running
my first OM1 basic agent.

## What I learned

- How to structure a simple Python agent
- How to run an agent locally using PowerShell
- How file paths affect running Python scripts
- How agents print status and system time

## Challenges faced

- Initially ran the script from the wrong directory
- Learned how to navigate folders using `cd`
- Understood how Python locates files

## Outcome

Successfully ran the agent locally and confirmed correct execution.

## Next steps

- Explore OM1 runtime configuration
- Learn how agents register with OpenMind
- Connect agents with API keys in future experiments
